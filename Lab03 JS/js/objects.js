then open this page in a browser and enter 'person' in the console */

called "greeting" that creates an alert dialog, then type person.greeting() into the console */

    and interests in a string that is output to an alert dialog */
output.textContent = person.bio(); // Display bio in the paragraph

// The object above is called an 'object literal' - in that we build each part of the object manually,
// rather than instantiating it from a class (which we will cover later).
// Objects can be easier to work with than arrays, as you can name each element

/* STEP 5a: Dot syntax allows you to access the parts of an object - the first part is the namespace,
and subsequent parts are used to access things encapsulated within the object. Access the name, age,
and gender of the person object, and put it inside the <p id="output"></p>. */

/* STEP 5b: Update the above bio() function inside the person object to return
the string, instead of the alert(). */

/* STEP 7: You can also use bracket notation, just like an array - objects that are built this way are often referred to as associative arrays */
console.log(person["address"]); // "1 Georgian Drive"

/* STEP 8: You can also set members of an object - try changing the person's name, and age */
person.age = 80;

/* STEP 9a: It is also possible to add new members to an object - include eye color - and type person.eyeColor in the console */

console.log(person["hairColor"]); // Black

/* STEP 11a: 'this' is very useful - it allows us to refer to the object in question, specifically.
This will become much clearer later in the course. Create two new objects,
each with a name, and a function that outputs the name */

in the console to see how 'this' is specific to each object */
person1.hello(); // "Hello, this is P1."

// You have already been using objects all along:
let myString = 'Words, words, words.'; // This creates an instance of the class String
const elem = document.getElementById('output'); // This accesses the Document object, which is created (instantiated) when the browser opens the HTML page
